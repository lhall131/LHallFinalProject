The Personal Writing Wiki is a program that will allow you to make text documents for various people/places/things in whatever writing project you are working on. These text documents will be saved in a folder in your computer’s “Documents” directory. You are free to edit these files in the program itself or you can open the files in other writing programs (such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice.)

When you open the program you will see 4 buttons:

	Add Entry – This is the text file; the “Title” box will be where you write the title of the .txt file 	and the main window below is where you will type out the content saved to that specific file.
	
	Open Project Folder – This is the folder that your .txt files/entries will save in. They default to 	your main Documents directory, but you can open folders in other directories if you’d like. 
	
	New Project Folder – This allows you to make a new folder to store your .txt files/entries. ‘

	Open Folder Entries – This opens the folder showing you all of the .txt files that are in your 	current selected project 

To use this program you will first create a new project folder. 
You can name this whatever you want, and you can have as many as you want. 
After you have made the project folder you are free to add entries; again you can add as many as you want and they will all save in the project folder that you have made. 
When you are done and come back to the application later, you will need to click on Open Project Folder to select any of the folders you made. If you try and add an entry without first making a project folder or opening an existing one, it will give you an error and you cannot continue. 

And that’s it! It’s just a simple way to quickly write individual text documents when you are planning writing. 
Happy creating!
